Tasko will be a simple "to-do list" Android app with a server backend (to use the same list of tasks from multiple clients).

There are probably already hundreds of apps that can do this ([Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/) for example), but this one is mainly for learning purposes (write a mobile app with a backend service).

**Note that this is not a hosted service like Remember the Milk!  
It comes with a server backend that you have to host yourself, on your own server!**

*The name "Tasko" just means ["task" in Esperanto](http://translate.google.com/#en/eo/task).  
(in order to find a good name for the project, I played around with words like "task", "todo" etc. in Google Translate)*
